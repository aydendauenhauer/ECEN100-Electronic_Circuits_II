This repository contains my Project 1 for ECEN 100, where I used MATLAB to model a two-capacitor RC network with nodal analysis, compute its frequency response over a wide range of angular frequencies, and study component tolerances by randomly varying resistor and capacitor values. The project includes custom functions to solve the node equations, plot magnitude response on a semilog scale, and generate multiple response curves to visualize how element variations affect circuit behavior.
