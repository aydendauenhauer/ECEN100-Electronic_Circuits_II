# ECEN100-Electronic_Circuits_II
ECEN 100 – Electric Circuits II lab projects. The goal of these labs is to practice fundamental circuit analysis and design concepts, including AC steady-state analysis, phasors, frequency response, resonance, op-amp circuits, and transient behavior using tools such as MATLAB, along with physical measurements on the bench.
