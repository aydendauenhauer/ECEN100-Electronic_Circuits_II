# ECEN100-Electronic_Circuits_II
This repository contains my ECEN 100 – Electric Circuits II lab projects, completed at Santa Clara University. The goal of these labs is to practice fundamental circuit analysis and design concepts, including AC steady-state analysis, phasors, frequency response, resonance, op-amp circuits, and transient behavior using tools such as SPICE and MATLAB, along with physical measurements on the bench. The repository includes simulation files, calculation work, lab reports, and any supporting documentation or data. This project is shared for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. If you are currently enrolled in ECEN 100, please do not copy this work or submit it as your own. Follow SCU’s academic integrity policies.
